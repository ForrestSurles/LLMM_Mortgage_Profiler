# ~~~ LLMM Mortgage Profiler ~~~

Welcome to the **02_Module Challenge** script!

>This ___new___, and ***improved*** version includes everything <u>___you___</u> need to handle loan applications for `<company_name>` leveraging the **BRAND NEW** and *cutting edge* ***CSV*** file-type.<br><br>
_'Need a loan to lean on???_<br><br>
_Call_ <u>Lean Loan Mortgage Management</u> (or <u>LLM</u> for short!)<br>
_to find out what you qualify for.. today!!!_

This script, when activated from the `challenge` parent folder by entering the command:
>`python app.py`

into the command line, and the interactive script will execute.<br>
<sup>_(at any time, you can press the key combination CTRL + C (control-c) to exit the script and return to the command line.)_</sup>

The primary purpose of this script is to take in a list of potential loan products in the form of a csv file and based upon the user's input will filter the list of loans to show only those loans which the user *passes base qualifications*.<br><br>
The aim is to provide a more automated experience to the mortgage banking officer in their day-to-day operations.
